          Ginga Sengoku Gun'yūden Rai (銀河戦国群雄伝ライ, lit. "Galaxy Warring
          State Chronicle Rai") is a Japanese manga series written and
          illustrated by George Manabe. It was first serialized in Kadokawa
          Shoten's Comic Comp Magazine beginning November 1989 up to January
          1993. The series transferred publication to MediaWorks's Dengeki Comic
          Gao! magazine from February 1993 to November 2001. The series focuses
          on Rai Ryuga, a young courageous warrior who seeks to unify the cosmos
          in a war against other two powerful forces. The series borrows heavily
          from events of the Sengoku period and events from the Chinese
          historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. After the collapse of
          the Sacred Galaxy Empire, a battle for control of the Milky Way Galaxy
          breaks out among the warlords. From the chaos emerges a young
          courageous warrior, Rai Ryuga. He is a fearless warrior to his foes
          but to others, he is a gentle soul, dependable and loyal. Two powerful
          forces aspire to reign over the entire empire: Hiki Danjo, ruler of
          the Northern Region of the Milky Way, and Lord Masamune, ruler of the
          Southern Region. Rai sees the ensuing battle and ponders the ultimate
          goal: to battle against other factions in order to reunify the Milky
          Way under one ruler and that one day he will bring peace to the
          galaxy. Rai Ryuga (竜我 雷, Ryūga Rai) Voiced by: Shinichiro Ohta
          (Audio Drama), Nobuyuki Hiyama (Anime) The protagonist and a hero of
          the series. His actual age remain unknown but in the manga he was
          about 18 years old at the time he was in Danjo's army. He joined the
          Army of the Kingdom of Gojo as a Private, but he was quickly promoted
          to platoon leader and, later, as battalion commander after successive
          victories in critical battles. In the anime, Rai is portrayed as more
          of a hero and is more one dimensional compared to his manga
          appearance. In the manga, he begins with an attitude similar to his
          anime portrayal, but as the story progresses, his ambitions leave
          consequences that enable him to rise higher within the ranks of the
          galactic kingdoms at the expense of the lives of numerous key
          characters ; this makes Rai a more complex individual who, as he keeps
          gaining more power, is tragically torn between choosing the right
          thing to do and following his ambition to become the emperor
          regardless of the casualties. After Shimon's death in both versions,
          Rai vows to become a just ruler who will unite the galaxy and protect
          the people living in peace. His overzealous dream of becoming the
          ruler of the galaxies serves as Gen'i's main source of strength,
          indirectly causing Simone's death and much of the conflicts fought by
          Rai throughout the story. In the manga's special epilogue chapter, an
          older Rai (now emperor) meets Jamka, the son he conceived through a
          secret affair with Lord Masamune, and the one who would truly realize
          Simone's dream of unifying the galaxy.
